# About this project
We all use sorting algorithms to sort and make list, array in some sort of order and I visualised these process in my project. Sorting visualisation is my personal project that visualised six different sorting algorithms such as selection, bubble, merge or quick sort - I did the project in Python with pygame library.

The solution for this project is coded in python using library pygame. There is only one object in this project, bar, has attribute of x, y, width and height represent for its value and its position in the list. The project has six different sorting algorithms in total including:
1. Selection sort
2. Bubble sort
3. Merge sort
4. Quick sort
5. Heap sort
6. Insertion sort

# Technology used:
* Python
* Pygame

# Concepts in the project:
* Data strucutre (list, tuple, Binary Heap)
* Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
* Conditional statements
* Function from pygame library
* Recursion
